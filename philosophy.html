        <p class="lead">Iago has a specific point of view about load testing. Understanding 
          that point of view will help in making a decision to use it.</p>
        <p>First of all, Iago is primarily a load generation library. It is designed
          to be used by software engineers who have some familiarity with a JVM language such as
          Java or Scala. While it's possible to use Iago as a stand-alone load testing application,
          this is not its strong suit today and you will probably be happier with other tools
          if that is what you need.</p>
        <p>That said, it is also designed to be very easy to use. It usually requires
          more code to write a test client than it does to write a load test using Iago. Indeed,
          the code from a test client is usually just what you need to write your load test. This
          is deliberate, because we believe that people who most need Iago are those who find
          themselves writing their own load tests late at night after a release has gone bad.
          Use Iago, it's easier!</p>
        <p>Another strong suit of Iago is its ability to accurately replicate production traffic,
          with a heavy emphasis on modelling open systems (ie, systems which recieve requests
          independent of their ability to service them). Unlike many open source and commercially
          available load generators, Iago does not attempt to model users with threads, has no
          concept of think time, and is not particularly amenable to characterizing load in terms
          of concurrent users</p>
        </p>Instead, Iago focuses on requests per second and has built-in support for statistical
          models such as an exponential distribution (used to model a Poisson Process), uniform
          distributions, as well as supporting easily writing your own request distribution either
          in terms of sums of distribution or your own implementation. Under the hood, Iago goes
          the extra mile in terms of reliably meeting the arrival times your distribution specifies,
          even when rates and wait times are high.</p>
        <p>Speaking of high request rates, Iago supports arbitrarily high rates of traffic via
          built-in support for creating clusters. At Twitter, engineers regularly run load tests
          that generate in excess of 100K requests per second or more. Single instances of Iago
          can easily achieve anywhere from 1K to 10K rps from commodity hardware, only limited by
          the particulars of your protocol needs.</p>
        <p>Equally important is Iago's ability to be extended. Because our target users are other
          engineers, it is critical that every possible knob be available to turn. In fact, you
          can easily write your own knobs, protocols, data sources, management interfaces or
          whatever else you can imagine because Iago's components are designed from the ground
          up to be extended or replaced.
        <p>In short, Iago is the load generator we used to wish we had. Now that we've written
          it, we want to share it with like-minded engineers who appreciate its capabilities.</p>
